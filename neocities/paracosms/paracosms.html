It has existed for trillions of years, and hosts most of the universe's population as a result. What happens in this system has an effect on almost every other paracosm in existence.">

It controls nearly all technological advancements and has the deepest connection with the Gods because of the Queen's residence.

                    Eartha Major has become a massive industrial hub in the Severance solar system, as well as a major political power. It takes care of almost all intergalactic affairs and is responsible for almost all manufacturing of space-centric machinery, such as spaceships, spacesuits, and weaponry.
                    <br>
                    Eartha Major is known for it's violent nature and patriotism, and is not afraid to discard anything they view as unnecessary, or a hinderance. ">

It is heavily guarded and the population is extremely prejudiced. While the planet is still liable to following the rules of the hub planet, there are many structural changes and any rules that Severance is lenient about are most likely modified on this planet.">

The planet boasts a smaller population than most planets (10.2 billion), but it is a major tourist location for people from Eartha Major and other unnamed planets.
