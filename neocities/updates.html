            <h3>3/12</h3>
            <p>
                <strong>Phone will be broken!</strong>
                <br>
                A sizable update with some quality of life changes and a few new editions! It shouldn't have taken this
                long, but class got in the way. I should be coming back to it now that time constraints are no longer a
                thing for me.
            <ul>
                <li>- Reworked the entire theme switcher logic </li>
                <li class="two">- It should be a little less buggy and it's now modular, meaning that more can be added
                    MUCH easier.</li>
                <li class="two">- As a result, however, the app will only be accessible on the main page (bloom.html)
                    because of some issues I am still working out. Soon there will be a fix, but for now, it works!</li>
                <li>- Added Retrowave Theme for the homepage and the phone.</li>
                <li class="two">- More pages are coming very soon! I really love this theme!</li>
                <li>- Added dark theme to IdolMessenger</li>
                <li>- Updated Paracosms page with flags for each planet! </li>
                <li class="two">- Also got rid of the temporary gumball planet</li>
                <li>- Added more music to Serenade</li>
                <li>- Bugfixed Widgetsmith a bit</li>
                <li class="two">- That pesky add button should now be gone when it needs to be</li>
                <li class="two">- Also added an FAQ for it</li>
                <li>- App Icons are now rearrangable with drag and drop!</li>
                <li class="two">- I intend to allow y'all to drag them between homepage screens as well, but that comes
                    later!</li>
                <li class="two">- Technically, you can pull some shenanigans with the overflow to move apps between the
                    2 homepages, but it's not intended, so please do not report any bugs that happen as a result! That
                    being said, if you'd like to fiddle with it, happy fiddling!</li>
                <li class="two">- You can reset the layout in the settings app if you need.</li>
                <li class="two">Widgets do break the layout, so you will have to reset your homepage layout every time
                    you add or remove one. See the Widgetsmith FAQ for more info!</li>
                <li>- Added a new mutual to IdolFinder</li>
                <li>- Other smaller (more invisible) changes!</li>
            </ul>
            I'd consider this a medium sized update. Anyways, enjoy!

                    homepage</li>
                <li>- New apps added:</li>

                Another big update! This one brings 2 new apps named Your Tome and Mellow, HarrowRing (a webring for
                those
                who like unsettling aesthetics), general html cleanup, SERENADE FINALLY WORKING PROPERLY (HOPEFULLY),
                and a
                completed game log!
                <br>
                Your Tome and Mellow absolutely killed me inside just so y'all know. Also, Serenade updates are going to
                be
                the "Removed Herobrine" patch notes of my site.
