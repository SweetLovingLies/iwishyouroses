        <h2>2024</h2>

        <div class="update">
            <h3>12/27</h3>
            <p>
                <strong>Phone CSS may be broken!</strong>
                <br>
                Removed all of the Christmas stuff! I hope you had a happy holidays!!

            <h3>12/18</h3>
            <p>
                <strong>Phone will be broken!</strong>
                <br>
                Another big update! This one brings 2 new apps named Your Tome and Mellow, HarrowRing (a webring for
                those
                who like unsettling aesthetics), general html cleanup, SERENADE FINALLY WORKING PROPERLY (HOPEFULLY),
                and a
                completed game log!
                <br>
                Your Tome and Mellow absolutely killed me inside just so y'all know. Also, Serenade updates are going to
                be
                the "Removed Herobrine" patch notes of my site.
            </p>
